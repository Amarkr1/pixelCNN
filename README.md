# Generating images pixel by pixel
### This repository contains code for training an image generator using the pixelCNN architecture as described in [Conditional Image Generation with PixelCNN Decoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05328)

Salient features: No blind spots, efficient implemenattion of vertical stacks and horizontal stacks and good generation results :D

TODO: Implement gated activation and conditional generation.
